# LAH17 - App for the Live at Heart festival taking place in Ã–rebro

The last two years I've made an app for the Live at Heart festival in my hometown. Every year I've built the app from the ground up.
The reason is mainly because it's what I've been doing on my day job. Which is a nice thing to do to practice your coding.

2015; Objective-C  
2016; Swift  
2017; React Native  

## This years approach

This year I thought I would shake it up a bit and open source the complete project. To my surprise, the backend still works! So that part I'll take care of, but I would love to get some help writing the app. There's a long list of features that people have requested (not really a list, but I've heard a lot of feature requests). The reason is that I know a lot of coders that's really in to music as well.

This means in short that you can pull request this project and I'll take care of the rest. I'll package and distribute it.

This project is perfect if you're new to React Native or want to try something cool on your spare time.

## Pull requests

Please, make me work! But I'd love to get some info about your PR. Please add a comment what you wanted to do and how you did it. If you write good code that shouldn't be a problem, right?

## Stack

We're using React Native with as little native code as possible, ok? By this approach I think we've put the project on a probono project level. This app should be about fun, not about work!

## Rewards

If you contribute well, you'll get some free tickets to the festival. Let's say that fixing a UI bug doesn't give you a festival pass, but a customized personal schedule does...
